## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `TeamListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` (athlete) and `Team` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an athlete).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the RelayCoach App data i.e., all `Person` (athlete) objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` (athlete) objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* also stores the currently 'selected' `Team` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Team>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
* toggles between displaying `Person`s and `Team`s in the UI when executing commands that affect either `Person`s or `Team`s (e.g. deleting teams display `Team`s, deleting athletes display `Person`s).

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` (athlete) needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml"/>

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both RelayCoach App data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Cascading operations between Athletes and Teams

#### Cascading deletions on athlete removal

When an athlete is deleted via `DeleteCommand`, the system also deletes any team that includes that athlete. Rationale:
- Teams must always have **exactly 4** members; removing one would violate the invariant.
- The `Model` exposes `getTeamOfPerson(Person)` to locate the team, and `deleteTeam(Team)` is invoked after `deletePerson(Person)` if applicable.
- The `DeleteCommand` composes a combined success message for both deletions.

#### Cascading updates on athlete edits

When athlete information is updated, the athlete information in the athlete's team will update as well.

### Teams and Sessions

This project extends AB-3 with `Team` and `Session` domain entities and corresponding commands.

- Teams are groups of exactly 4 distinct athletes (`Person`).
- Sessions represent training events with a location and start/end datetimes, attached to teams.

Key model classes:
- `seedu.address.model.team.Team` (holds `TeamName`, members, sessions)
- `seedu.address.model.team.session.Session` (holds `Location`, `startDate`, `endDate`)
- `seedu.address.model.team.UniqueTeamList` (manages uniqueness and storage of teams)

Relevant CLI prefixes (see `CliSyntax`): `tn/` (team name), `i/` (index), `l/` (location), `sdt/` (start), `edt/` (end).

Implemented commands:
- `team tn/TEAM_NAME i/IDX1 IDX2 IDX3 IDX4` â€” create a team of 4 athletes.
    - Constraints: exactly 4 distinct valid athlete indexes; members cannot already belong to another team; team name must be unique.
- `listteams` â€” list all teams.
- `deleteteam INDEX` â€” delete a team by displayed index in the team list.
- `addsession i/TEAM_INDEX sdt/YYYY-MM-DD HHmm edt/YYYY-MM-DD HHmm l/LOCATION` â€” add a session to a team.
    - Constraints: team index must be valid; `end` must not be before `start`; location and datetimes must satisfy format and validation rules.
- `deletesession i/TEAM_INDEX si/SESSION_INDEX` â€” delete a session from a team.
    - Notes: sessions are ordered by start datetime (`Session.SESSION_ORDER`) when interpreting `SESSION_INDEX`.

High-level logic and model interactions:
- Commands are parsed in `AddressBookParser` and delegated to specific parsers (`AddTeamCommandParser`, `AddSessionCommandParser`, etc.).
- `ModelManager` updates teams immutably: when adding or removing a session, it constructs a new `Team` instance with updated session sets and replaces the existing team in the RelayCoach App.

Design considerations:
- Team immutability avoids side-effects when editing nested collections (sessions, members).
- Session indices are resolved against a deterministic ordering to ensure predictable deletion behavior.

### Listing Athletes and Teams

This project displays a list of athletes by default but will display either athletes or teams depending on the command being executed.
- Any athlete-related commands (e.g. `add`, `delete`, `find`) are implemented to display athletes by default after execution.
- Any team-related commands (e.g. `team`, `listteams`) are implemented to display teams by default after execution.
- Each team displays its members in alphabetical order and its sessions in chronological order based on start datetime and end datetime.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current RelayCoach App state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous RelayCoach App state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone RelayCoach App state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial RelayCoach App state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single RelayCoach App state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th athlete in the RelayCoach App. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the RelayCoach App after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted RelayCoach App state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new athlete. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified RelayCoach App state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the RelayCoach App state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the athlete was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous RelayCoach App state, and restores the RelayCoach App to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the RelayCoach App to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest RelayCoach App state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the RelayCoach App, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all RelayCoach App states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire RelayCoach App.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the athlete being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
School coaches that coach relay teams in different schools. They:
* have a need to manage a significant number of athletes and teams
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing to mouse interactions
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 
Given that coaches generally have many athletes to keep track of, our product aims to help 
coaches manage athletes and teams from different schools faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

    2. Test case: `edit 1 r/Sprinter t/Captain`
        - **Expected:** Success message. Athlete at index 1 now has updated role and tag.

---

#### 4. Find Athlete

As the list grows, you need to quickly find specific athletes.

1. **Finding athletes by name**
    1. Test case: `find n/Alice`
        - **Expected:** Only athletes with "Alice" in their name are listed.

2. **Filtering by tag or role**
    1. Test case: `find t/Sprinter`
        - **Expected:** Only athletes tagged as "Sprinter" are shown.

---

#### 5. Add Team

With your athletes in place, you proceed to group them into teams.

1. **Creating a team of 4 athletes**
    1. Prerequisite: At least 4 athletes listed via `list`.
    2. Test case: `team tn/Alpha i/1 2 3 4`
        - **Expected:** Success message. Team "Alpha" appears in the teams list with 4 members.

---

#### 6. Adding sessions

You want to schedule training sessions for your teams.

1. **Adding a session to a team**
    1. Prerequisite: At least one team exists; note its index from `listteams`.
    2. Test case: `addsession i/1 sdt/2025-10-21 0700 edt/2025-10-21 0800 l/Track`
        - **Expected:** Success message showing session details added to the team.

---

#### 7. Deleting sessions

Sometimes, you need to remove a session from a team's schedule.

1. **Deleting a session from a team**
    1. Prerequisite: Team at index `1` has at least one session.
    2. Test case: `deletesession i/1 si/1`
        - **Expected:** Success message and session is removed.

---

#### 8. Delete Team

You may need to remove teams as circumstances change.

1. **Listing teams**
    1. Test case: `listteams`
        - **Expected:** All teams are shown. If none exist, shows an empty team list section.

2. **Deleting a team**
    1. Prerequisite: At least one team exists (from `listteams`).
    2. Test case: `deleteteam 1`
        - **Expected:** First team is deleted, success message.

---

#### 9. Deleting Athletes and Cascading Effects

Occasionally, an athlete leaves. You remove them and observe how the system updates related teams.

1. **Deleting an athlete while all athletes are shown**
    1. Prerequisite: List all athletes using the `list` command. Multiple athletes are present.
    2. Test case: `delete 1`
        - **Expected:** First athlete is deleted from the list. If the athlete belonged to a team, that team is also deleted. Success message lists all deletions.

---

#### 10. Saving and Reloading Data

You want to ensure your data persists between sessions.

## **Appendix: Effort**

#### Difficulty level: Medium - High

**Technical Challenges faced**

1. Extended person model to support additional attributes:
    1. Adding new attributes to the existing `Person` model in AB3 required careful modification of multiple classes
       to ensure data consistency and sufficient validation.
2. Advanced search functionality:
    1. Implementing multi-criteria search (by name, school, role, tags...)
       required complex parsing and filtering logic, which was more challenging than simple single-criterion searches in AB3.
2. Complex entity relationship management:
    1. Whilst AB3 only deals with one entity type, RelayCoach manages multiple interconnected entities (Athletes, Teams, Sessions),
       necessitating careful design to maintain data integrity and consistency.
    2. Ensured data integrity during deletions: Deleting an athlete required cascading deletions of associated teams,
       which added complexity to the delete operations.

#### Effort distribution

Estimated manhours spent: 120 hours

**High-Complexity Tasks (40% of effort)**
1. Designing the relational architecture between athletes, teams, and sessions
2. Implementing complex validation rules for team composition
3. Ensuring data integrity across interconnected entities

**Medium-Complexity Tasks (35% of effort)**
1. Extending existing AB3 components without breaking functionality
2. Implementing new field types with custom validation
3. Creating new command parsers and logic

**Routine Implementation Tasks (25% of effort)**
1. UI component updates
2. Additional test cases
3. Documentation updates

#### Technical Achievements
1. Successfully extended AB3's Person model while maintaining all existing functionality
2. Implemented complex business rules for team formation (exactly 4 unique athletes)
3. Created a relational system between athletes, teams, and training sessions
4. Built advanced search that outperforms AB3's basic find functionality
5. Maintained data integrity across multiple interconnected entities

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

#### **1. Show team information for each athlete**

**Description:**  
Enhance the person list panel to include details about the team each athlete belongs to.
Coaches can better see which team the athlete belongs to at a glance.

#### **2. Show attendance for each athlete**

**Description:**
Implement attendance feature to track session attendance for each athlete.
Coaches can mark or unmark session attendance for each athlete.
Provide summary statistics such as attendance rate and missed sessions in the person list panel.
Coaches can better see which athlete is committed or not.

#### **3. Auto deletion of sessions after the end date & time has passed**

**Description:**  
Sessions whose end date & time has passed will be deleted automatically.
This will maintain a clutter-free and up-to-date session list for the teams.

#### **4. Indexed commands only work for the currently displayed list of athletes or teams**

**Description:**  
Indexed commands such as `edit`, `delete` and `find` should only work for the currently displayed list of athletes or teams.
Using a team-related command on an athlete list (and vice versa) will result in an error message.
This will prevent coaches from accidentally deleting or editing athletes or teams that are not displayed.
